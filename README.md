Some nut wack hack job for 5.0.x before Checkpoint works

Seriously, y'all just need to wait for Checkpoint...

But since I know no one would listen to me and try to use this mess anyway...

Here's an update.

Save dump now supports games that uses sub folders like botw, and will be saved to `save` by pressing A (will overwrite whatever's already in there.) Pressing X will inject whatever data that's present in `inject` (sometimes doesn't work, not sure why yet, but use at your own risk and always have backups.)

Build it with libnx 26d2e6d7f40d4611c8caab53efc1f9980f603dad for 5.0.x btw. You'll need to find your own user id you get with FsSaveDataIterator.

What have I done?
