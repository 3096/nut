# Y'allAreNUTs

Use UP & DOWN, LEFT & RIGHT to select a save to dump. All dumps will be saved to `save` by pressing A or `save/{titleID}/{userID}/` by pressing Y (will overwrite whatever's already in there.) Press ZR to dump all saves. Pressing X will inject all data that's present in `inject` (sometimes doesn't work due to service being broken on 5.0 and without using it, fsdevCommitDevice() can fail... Use at your own risk and always have backups)

This wasn't something that I wanted to release, but since many people didn't want to wait for Checkpoint, I had to make it a bit more usable so it doesn't get too messy too quickly.

I don't intend on spending any more time on this tool since you should probably just use Checkpoint or JKSV. If you want to make any improvements, you're welcome to create a pull request.
